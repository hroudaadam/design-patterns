# Design patterns
this project contains examples of design patterns to help me understand them better

## Creational

### Abstract factory
provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes

### Factory
creates object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refers to newly created object using a common interface

### Builder
separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations

### Singleton
restricts the instantiation of a class to one instance

### Prototype
specifies the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype

### Object pool
set of initialized objects kept ready to use

### Multiton
TODO!

### Dependency Injection
TODO!

## Structural

### Adapter (Wrapper)
converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect

### Decorator
allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class

### Proxy
controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object

### Composite
TODO! 

### Bridge
TODO!

### Facade
TODO!

### Flyweight
TODO!

## Behavioural

### Observer
defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically

### State
allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes

### Strategy
enables selecting an algorithm at runtime

### Mediator
TODO!

### Memento
TODO!

### Command
TODO!
### Iterator
TODO!

### Chain of responsibility
TODO!

### Interpreter
TODO!
