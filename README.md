# Design patterns

## Creational

### Abstract factory
lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes

### Factory method
creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created

### Builder
intent is to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation

### Singleton
restricts the instantiation of a class to one instance

### Prototype
lets you copy existing objects

### Object pool
set of initialized objects kept ready to use

### Multiton
xxx

### Dependency Injection
xxx

## Structural

### Adapter (Wrapper)
allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface

### Decorator
allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class

### Proxy
controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object

### Composite
xxx 

### Bridge
xxx

### Facade
xxx

### Flyweight
xxx

## Behavioural

### Observer
if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically

### State
allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes

### Strategy
enables selecting an algorithm at runtime

### Mediator
xxx !!!

### Memento
xxx !!!

### Command
xxx

### Iterator

### Chain of responsibility
xxx

### Interpreter
